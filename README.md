# Dartboard Cricket Scoreboard

The Dartboard Cricket Scoreboard is a web application that allows users to keep track of their Cricket games on a digital scoreboard. It offers the following features:

## Features

1. **1 v 1 or 2 v 2 Gameplay:** Enjoy friendly matches with friends in a head-to-head battle or team up for thrilling doubles games. Whether you prefer intense one-on-one competitions or a more collaborative team play, this scoreboard accommodates both options.

2. **Custom Avatars:** Personalize your gaming experience by choosing from a wide range of quirky and expressive avatars. Alternatively, unleash your creativity and take a fun selfie with your device's camera to instantly create a unique avatar for yourself.

3. **Marks Per Round (MPR) Tracking:** Stay on top of your performance with the built-in MPR tracking system. As you hit those targets on the dartboard, the scoreboard will automatically calculate your MPR, providing valuable insights into your accuracy and consistency.

4. **Undo Move:** Don't fret over unintended or mistaken inputs. With the "Undo" button, you can easily correct any accidental moves, ensuring a fair and smooth gaming experience for everyone.
