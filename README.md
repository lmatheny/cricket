Certainly! Here's the revised README for your Dartboard Cricket Scoreboard project with a more professional tone:

# Dartboard Cricket Scoreboard

The Dartboard Cricket Scoreboard is a web application that provides a digital scoreboard to keep track of Cricket games. It offers the following features:

## Features

1. **1 v 1 or 2 v 2 Gameplay:** Engage in one-on-one competitions or team up for doubles matches. The scoreboard accommodates both game modes, allowing users to choose their preferred gameplay style.

2. **Custom Avatars:** Personalize your gaming experience by selecting from a variety of avatars. Alternatively, users can use their device's camera to capture a picture for a custom avatar, adding a personal touch to the game.

3. **Marks Per Round (MPR) Tracking:** The scoreboard intelligently tracks each player's Marks Per Round (MPR) as the game progresses. This feature enables players to monitor their performance and assess their accuracy and consistency over time.

4. **Undo Move:** To ensure a fair and enjoyable gaming experience, the "Undo" button allows users to revert unintended or mistaken moves during the game.
